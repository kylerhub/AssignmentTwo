Assignment 2

In the second milestone I learned how to use MapKit and CoreLocation to visualise the name, latitude and longitude coordinates in an interactive map.

I have implemented these concepts to add a navigation link to my detail view to display the full information of that location, which includes the name of the location, its coordinates, as well as an interactive map showing the location. The map updates whenever the coordinates of the location change. The user can change the location (coordinates) interactively through the map.
