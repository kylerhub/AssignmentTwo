Assignment 2

In the third milestone I learned how to use online location services, including
geo-coding, reverse geo-coding,and sunrise/sunset times.

I have implemented these concepts to convert forwards and backwards between a location name and its geographical coordinates for each place in the app.
The navigation link to the detail view to display the full location information of that place, which includes the name of the location, its coordinates, as well as an interactive map showing the place. The map updates whenever the coordinates of the location change, and it allows the user to change the coordinates interactively through the map.
